A simple, interactive Python console app for testing and comparing interest-only buy-to-let (BTL) mortgage deals for limited company (SPV) purchases in the UK. Input your property price, rental income, and deposit details, then evaluate pre-loaded deals from top lenders (e.g., Molo Finance, CHL Mortgages) or custom rates. Calculates key metrics like cash flow, yields, and rental coverage ratios (ICR) to help assess affordability and profitability.
Based on October 2025 market rates—ideal for property investors crunching numbers quickly without spreadsheets.

Pre-loaded Deals: Top limited company BTL options at 75% LTV (e.g., 2.30% from CHL with 7% fee).
Custom Inputs: Test your own rates, terms, and scenarios.
Key Calculations:

Monthly interest payments (interest-only).
Annual cash flow (after agent fees, maintenance, insurance).
Gross/net rental yields.
ICR at pay rate and stressed rate (5.5% for lender affordability checks).

Robust Input Handling: Supports comma-separated numbers (e.g., "410,000") and defaults.
No Dependencies: Pure Python 3—runs anywhere.
